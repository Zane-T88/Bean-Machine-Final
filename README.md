# Bean-Machine-Final

This is my first official website reated using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. The template was provided to me Mimo Developers, as they provided me the education for my coding basics. This website's goal is to represent an eCommerce website selling coffee beans. Features include a search bar, a sorting button, and adaptaple dimensions for different screen sizes. This website is to showcase my skills as a front end developer and VS code was used as my editor, while Github is responsible for handling my repositories. You can find a local link to my website through Github Pages here: https://zane-t88.github.io/Bean-Machine-Final/
